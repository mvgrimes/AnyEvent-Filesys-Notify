Changes for AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify

0.22 - Tue Mar  5 14:15:44 EST 2013
    This is an important release for KQueue users. Prior versions had several
    bugs in the KQueue backend. As a result, KQueue was effectively polling
    the filesystem with no delay. KQueue has a serious limitation which makes
    it impractical for monitoring medium to large sets of files (namely,
    you need an open filehandle for each directory AND file that you are 
    monitoring). The use of the KQueue backend is discouraged.

    - Fixes KQueue backend bug which causes CPU usage to peg at 100%
      (thank to gdxhsw++ for the bug report and patch)
    - Updates the documentation and issue warnings for KQueue filehandles
    - Fixes errors in documentation
    - Adds namespace::autoclean to the Event object

0.21 - Mon Feb  4 15:52:47 EST 2013
    Converts from File::Find::Rule to Path::Interator::Rule
    - Should speed things up marginally.
    - Adds benchmark and profiling tools

    Marks tests as TODO if we are on gnufreebsd or gnukfreebsd
    - Based on diag output, tests appear to work, but we get failures from
      cpantesters. I don't have access to this platform to investigate
      further.

0.19 - Mon Jan 14 20:30:38 EST 2013
    Fixes KQueue bugs.  This works on a Mac, hoping it will work on FreeBSD.

    Thanks to syohex for the patch.

    - Renames backend roles to reflect the implementation rather than the O/S
      (Inotify2, FSEvents and KQueue)
    - Adds the 'backend' argument to the constructor allow the user to force
      a particular backend
    - Guides the user to avoid no_external in the docs
