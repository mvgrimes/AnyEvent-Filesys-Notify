AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify - An AnyEvent compatible module to monitor files/directories for changes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify;

    my $notifier = AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify->new(
        dirs     => [ qw( this_dir that_dir ) ],
        interval => 2.0,             # Optional depending on underlying watcher
        filter   => sub { shift !~ /\.(swp|tmp)$/ },
        cb       => sub {
            my (@events) = @_;
            # ... process @events ...
        },
        parse_events => 1,  # Improves efficiency on certain platforms
    );

    # enter an event loop, see AnyEvent documentation
    Event::loop();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a cross platform interface to monitor files and
directories within an L<AnyEvent> event loop. The heavy lifting is done by
L<Linux::INotify2> or L<Mac::FSEvents> on their respective O/S. A fallback
which scans the directories at regular intervals is include for other systems.
See L</WATCHER IMPLEMENTATIONS> for more on the backends.

Events are passed to the callback (specified as a CodeRef to C<cb> in the
constructor) in the form of L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Event>s.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

A constructor for a new AnyEvent watcher that will monitor the files in the
given directories and execute a callback when a modification is detected. 
No action is take until a event loop is entered.

Arguments for new are:

=over 4

=item dirs 

    dirs => [ '/var/log', '/etc' ],

An ArrayRef of directories to watch. Required.

=item interval

    interval => 1.5,   # seconds

Specifies the time in fractional seconds between file system checks for
the L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Role::Fallback> implementation.

Specifies the latency for L<Mac::FSEvents> for the
C<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Role::FSEvents> implementation.

Ignored for the C<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Role::Inotify2> implementation.

=item filter

    filter => qr/\.(ya?ml|co?nf|jso?n)$/,
    filter => sub { shift !~ /\.(swp|tmp)$/,

A CodeRef or Regexp which is used to filter wanted/unwanted events. If this
is a Regexp, we attempt to match the absolute path name and filter out any
that do not match. If a CodeRef, the absolute path name is passed as the
only argument and the event is fired only if there sub returns a true value.

=item cb

    cb  => sub { my @events = @_; ... },

A CodeRef that is called when a modification to the monitored directory(ies) is
detected. The callback is passed a list of
L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Event>s. Required.

=item backend

    backend => 'Fallback',
    backend => 'KQueue',
    backend => '+My::Filesys::Notify::Role::Backend',

Force the use of the specified backend. The backend is assumed to have the
C<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify::Role> prefix, but you can force a fully qualified
name by prefixing it with a plus. Optional.

=item no_external

    no_external => 1,

This is retained for backward compatibility. Using C<backend => 'Fallback'>
is preferred. Force the use of the L</Fallback> watcher implementation. This is
not encouraged as the L</Fallback> implement is very inefficient, but it does
not require either L<Linux::INotify2> nor L<Mac::FSEvents>. Optional.

=item parse_events

    parse_events => 1,

In backends that support it (currently INotify2), parse the events instead of
rescanning file system for changed C<stat()> information. Note, that this might
cause slight changes in behavior. In particular, the Inotify2 backend will
generate an additional 'modified' event when a file changes (once when opened
for write, and once when modified).

=item skip_subdirs

    skip_subdirs => 1,

Skips subdirectories and anything in them while building a list of files/dirs
to watch. Optional.

=item max_depth

    max_depth => 1,

An apparent side effect of skip_subdirs is not being able to detect when
a directory is created inside the watched directory. One solution is to
instead specify the maximum depth while building a list of files/dirs to watch. 

Thus, this parameter can be set to any integer greater than 0 which specifies the
maximum depth in which you wish to scan for changes.

For those using backends that use a filehandle per object watched, this is
essential to keep filehandle count low and performance high. 

Optional.

=back

=head1 WATCHER IMPLEMENTATIONS

=head2 INotify2 (Linux)

Uses L<Linux::INotify2> to monitor directories. Sets up an C<AnyEvent-E<gt>io>
watcher to monitor the C<$inotify-E<gt>fileno> filehandle.

=head2 FSEvents (Mac)

Uses L<Mac::FSEvents> to monitor directories. Sets up an C<AnyEvent-E<gt>io>
watcher to monitor the C<$fsevent-E<gt>watch> filehandle.

=head2 KQueue (BSD/Mac)

Uses L<IO::KQueue> to monitor directories. Sets up an C<AnyEvent-E<gt>io>
watcher to monitor the C<IO::KQueue> object.

B<WARNING> - L<IO::KQueue> and the C<kqueue()> system call require an open
filehandle for every directory and file that is being watched. This makes
it impossible to watch large directory structures (and inefficient to watch
moderately sized directories). The use of the KQueue backend is discouraged.

=head2 Fallback

A simple scan of the watched directories at regular intervals. Sets up an
C<AnyEvent-E<gt>timer> watcher which is executed every C<interval> seconds
(or fractions thereof). C<interval> can be specified in the constructor to
L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify> and defaults to 2.0 seconds.

This is a very inefficient implementation. Use one of the others if possible.

=head1 Why Another Module For File System Notifications

At the time of writing there were several very nice modules that accomplish
the task of watching files or directories and providing notifications about
changes. Two of which offer a unified interface that work on any system:
L<Filesys::Notify::Simple> and L<File::ChangeNotify>.

L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify> exists because I need a way to simply tie the
functionality those modules provide into an event framework. Neither of the
existing modules seem to work with well with an event loop.
L<Filesys::Notify::Simple> does not supply a non-blocking interface and
L<File::ChangeNotify> requires you to poll an method for new events. You could
fork off a process to run L<Filesys::Notify::Simple> and use an event handler
to watch for notices from that child, or setup a timer to check
L<File::ChangeNotify> at regular intervals, but both of those approaches seem
inefficient or overly complex. Particularly, since the underlying watcher
implementations (L<Mac::FSEvents> and L<Linux::INotify2>) provide a filehandle
that you can use and IO event to watch.

This is not slight against the authors of those modules. Both are well 
respected, are certainly finer coders than I am, and built modules which 
are perfect for many situations. If one of their modules will work for you
by all means use it, but if you are already using an event loop, this
module may fit the bill.
